PincFloit with

(1) parallelized WKB module (MS-GWaM)

(2) dynamic Smagorinsky formulated for anisotropic grids

(3) small bug in output_wkb removed (re-dimensionalization energy)

(4) big round of changes by Elena:
(4.1) heating enabling baroclinic-wave life cycles
(4.2) more efficient pressure solver
(4.3) more efficient treatment of MUSCL
(4.4) potentially more ...

(5) semi-implicit time stepping with new discretization of the fluxes

(6) environmental state made steady by RHS of dynamical equations only using deviations from that state

(7) reconstruction of cell-face fields and construction of the fluxes according to suggestion from R. Klein- Old reconstruction and fluxes conserved in reconstruction_0 and momentumFlux_0

(8) heating implemented following O'Neill and Klein (2014)

(9) Held & Suarez (1994) implemented. Heating there proportional to the deviation of the potential-temperature difference (between model and the HS potential temperature) from its horizontal mean

(10) density relaxation

(11) horizontal Shapiro filter

(12) In case of BLC horizontal Shapiro Filter only acting on deviations from equilibrium state

(13) \overline{\rho'w} removed from dynamics with heating

...

(14) Many modifications by Fabienne Schmid
