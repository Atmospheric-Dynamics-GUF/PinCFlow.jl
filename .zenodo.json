    "description": "PinCFlow.jl is an atmospheric-flow solver that was designed for conducting idealized simulations. It integrates the Boussinesq, pseudo-incompressible and compressible equations in a conservative flux form, using a semi-implicit method that combines explicit and implicit time-stepping schemes. The Lagrangian WKB model MS-GWaM is interactively coupled to the dynamical core of PinCFlow.jl, so that unresolved gravity waves may be parameterized in a manner that accounts for transience and horizontal propagation.",
